This code is used in the paper, "Explicit Semiclassical Resonances from Many Delta Functions" by Ethan J. Brady. It numerically computes resonances via a root finding strategy to determine the accuracy of the theory. Many parameter sets used in the paper are commented, and they can be accessed by uncommenting one while commenting the active one. The double comment sign "%%" breaks MATLAB into blocks for the purpose of running code, which I do for cases of N = 2, 3, and 4. Only the chosen one of these should be run before running the latter sections. A discussion of the numerical method and results are in the paper, currently at the following.
